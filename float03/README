See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

Having more fun, this is a test that compares fixed point and floating
point execution time.

Note this is ram based not rom based, openocd supports the stlink
interfaces now.  Easy to use, no desoldering, no dfu-util, no second
usb cable.
