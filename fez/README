I have messed with the fez panda, not using it for .NET but using it
as an affordable board to program.  Sparkfun had a new FEZ product
in their lineup (well new to me I had not known of it) and looking at
the FEZ site found another:

http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/353/

Which uses the same chip as the stm32f4 discovery.  The fez website
mentions dfu mode with a pin shorted so that solves the problem of the
panda.  Like the stm32f4d we are talking a 168Mhz microcontroller if
you want to call it that, it has caches, an fpu, etc.

Now for whatever reason they left pads but no voltage regulator, so
you have two choices.  Buy a regulator and some caps and solder them
yourself or power it from somewhere else.  I find it bothersome that
this as with some other boards only put one 3.3V pin and one ground.
Anyway, so I use something like this:

With some jumper wires (and soldered pins in the FEZ cerb40) to power
the board as well as tie LODR high putting it in dfu mode.  I find it
works best if you plug the ftdi usb to serial board in last.  Plug in
the usb on the FEZ board then plug in the serial board being used
to power it.

I used to use this dfu-util one but it has been merged into the main so
it is obsolete
http://gitorious.org/~tormod/unofficial-clones/dfuse-dfu-util

The main page appears to be here
//http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/releases/

you can get the source above or with git
git clone git://git.openezx.org/dfu-util

If you used git then
./autogen.sh

from the tarball or git then:
./configure
make
make install

To write a program to the board, get ready to run the command below,
press the reset button, the led will blink fast then slow, when it
starts to blink slow then run the:

dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -c 1 -i 0 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D myprogram.bin

Once loaded then unplug the power to the board, remove the LODR jumper
and apply power again.
