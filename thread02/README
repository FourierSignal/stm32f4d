See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

Note the external 8MHz clock is used to get a stable 9600 baud on
the uart.

Derived from thread01.  The scheduler manages the timer so that it can
send messages to the threads at certain time intervals.
